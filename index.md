# 29th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments

# Overview
The 29th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2024
conference in San Francisco, California, USA, focuses on high-level programming
of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines.
Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996,
this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel
applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming
tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the
latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for
papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging
programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures.
An additional emphasis this year will be on post-von Neumann architectures and 
deep memories hierarchies to encourage new developments in programming models for HPC.
